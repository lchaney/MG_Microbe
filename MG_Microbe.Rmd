Prior to loading, data was cleaned as follows:  
* removed genotype 20 because it was not planted in all treatments  
* removed plants that never flowered: 10-2-1   5-3-1   12-1-3  
* deleted no germination, dead for any reason, wrong color in an inbred line  
  + removed 53 that died  
  + removed 82 that did not germinate  
  + removed 6 that were not correct color for line  
*this is essentially the tab 'Gina_man_deleteng' with no flowering removed*
